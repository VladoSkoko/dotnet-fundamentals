# Learning the Command Line Interface and SDK in C# and .NET

The .NET framework Software Development Kit (SDK) used to lack a unified command-line interface. This changed with the introduction of the .NET Core and the .NET SDK. When you install these SDKs, they include the .NET Command Line Interface (CLI), a set of tools for building, testing, and deploying .NET applications. The CLI provides a uniform approach for developers to interact with .NET on any operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The CLI is open-source and available on GitHub. This tutorial guides you through using the .NET CLI, providing examples and illustrating how to make the most of this valuable toolset.

## 1. The .NET CLI

The .NET CLI revolves around the `dotnet` driver, a single executable that enables interaction with the various components of the .NET CLI. Using it is as simple as typing `dotnet`, followed by the command name. If you need help, use the `h` switch:

```bash
dotnet -h
```

This command displays your current .NET version, the SDK version, and a list of available commands.

## 2. Basic Commands

The .NET CLI offers several basic commands that will be prefixed by `dotnet`. 

- `dotnet new`: Create a new project, configuration file, or solution based on a specified template.
- `dotnet build`: Build a project and all its dependencies.
- `dotnet run`: Run your application directly from the source code with one command, which builds the project first.
- `dotnet publish`: Publish your finished .NET project.

## 3. Creating a New Project

Before creating a new project, you can search available templates on the Microsoft servers using `dotnet new` with the `search` parameter. For example, to find templates related to Maui, type:

```bash
dotnet new search Maui
```

This command returns a list of templates, including Microsoft and third-party templates.

If you know the name of the template you want to use, create a new project using the following command:

```bash
dotnet new console -lang c# -o MyProject
```

This command creates a new project from the `console` template using C# (specified by `-lang c#`) and outputs the project to the `MyProject` directory.

## 4. Building the Project

Once your project is set up, compile and build it using the `dotnet build` command. Run this command inside the directory containing your project file (`.csproj` or `.vbproj`). 

```bash
cd MyProject
dotnet build
```

This command creates a `bin` directory containing the build output, including the executable and other files.

<a name="running-the-application"></a>
## 5. Running the Application

Run your application with the `dotnet run` command. This command automatically builds the project if the `bin` directory is not present, then runs your application.

```bash
dotnet run
```

You should see your program's output. In the case of a basic console application, it might be "Hello, World."

## 6. Publishing Your Application

Publish your application using `dotnet publish`. This command creates a `publish` folder in the `bin` directory, containing the files to distribute to end users.

```bash
dotnet publish
```

You can also create a self-contained version of your application, which includes all required .NET files for the application to run on the end user's computer. To build a self-contained application, use the `--self-contained` flag:

```bash
dotnet publish --self-contained true
```

This command creates a new folder in the `bin` directory specific to your operating system. Inside, you will find your executable and DLLs along with all necessary .NET files.
