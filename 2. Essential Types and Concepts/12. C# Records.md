# C# 9 and .NET: Understanding Records and Collections

With the advent of C# 9 in 2020, the `record` keyword was introduced. This keyword enables you to define a reference type with inbuilt functionality for encapsulating data. While this is technically a C# feature, it is often considered a new type in .NET due to its versatility and usefulness. This guide will delve into `record` types, their structure, and usage in the context of immutability, equality, and how they can simplify your code.

## Understanding Records

A `record` type serves as a blueprint for creating objects that function as immutable data containers. Immutability implies that the values within an object can't be modified post-creation. By default, records are immutable, whereas .NET classes are mutable unless explicitly coded otherwise. Crafting an immutable class takes additional effort and meticulousness to maintain its immutability while refactoring. Conversely, records provide built-in immutability unless specifically opted out during their definition.

Here's a brief comparison:

```csharp
// Record
public record CollectibleCard(string CardName, decimal Price, bool LimitedEdition);

// Class
public class CollectibleCardClass
{
    public string CardName { get; init; }
    public decimal Price { get; init; }
    public bool LimitedEdition { get; init; }
}
```

The record declaration is more concise and also provides immutability out of the box.

## Declaration and Instantiation

To instantiate a `record`, you can use the C# syntax with named or positional parameters. Named parameters involve specifying the property name followed by its value, while positional parameters require you to pass the values in the order of their declaration.

```csharp
// Named parameters
var card1 = new CollectibleCard(CardName: "Skedaddle", Price: 6, LimitedEdition: false);

// Positional parameters
CollectibleCard card2 = new("Skedaddle", 6, false);
```

## Value Semantics and Equality

Unlike classes where two objects are considered equal if they refer to the same memory location, in the case of structs and records, two objects are deemed equal if they are of the same type and store identical values.

```csharp
CollectibleCard card3 = new("Skedaddle", 7, false);

bool areCard1And2Equal = card1 == card2; // true
bool areCard1And3Equal = card1 == card3; // false
```

Here, `card1` and `card2` are equal because their values are identical, whereas `card1` and `card3` are unequal as their `Price` values differ.

## ToString and Records

Records in C# also provide a default implementation of the `ToString()` method, which returns the type's name and its property values in a well-formatted manner.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(card1); // Outputs: CollectibleCard { CardName = Skedaddle, Price = 6, LimitedEdition = false }
```

When the `ToString()` method is called on a record, it returns the name of the type followed by its property names and their respective values encapsulated within curly braces.
