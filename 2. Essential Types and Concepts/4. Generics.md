# Generics

.NET and its languages are built on the concept of a strong type system, which means every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. This is a benefit as strong typing helps prevent type mismatches and reduces the risk of type-related errors. However, it can lead to code explosion where we have to create lots of specialized versions of our code. .NET generics provide a way to create reusable, type-safe code that can handle a range of data types without having to write the same code again and again.

## Code Example Without Generics

Let's take a look at an example of how code works without generics. Consider the following implementation of a stack class called `ObjectStacker`:

```csharp
class ObjectStacker
{
    private object[] stack;
    private int top;

    public ObjectStacker()
    {
        stack = new object[100];
        top = -1;
    }

    public void Push(object item)
    {
        stack[++top] = item;
    }

    public object Pop()
    {
        return stack[top--];
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have a stack implementation that can store objects of any type. However, there are some disadvantages to this approach. Let's examine the usage of this code:

```csharp
ObjectStacker stack = new ObjectStacker();
stack.Push(3); // Boxing occurs when pushing an integer into an object
int number = (int)stack.Pop(); // Casting is required to retrieve the integer
stack.Push("hello"); // The stack can store strings as well, leading to less type safety
string str = stack.Pop().ToString(); // Syntax changes when retrieving a string
```

As you can see, using `ObjectStacker` without generics involves boxing and casting operations, which can have performance implications. Additionally, the lack of type safety allows storing different types of objects in the stack, making the code less robust and potentially prone to errors.

## Using Generics

Generics provide a solution to the issues mentioned above. When you define a generic in your code, you create a type parameter using angle brackets (`<>`). By convention, the type parameter is commonly named `T`, but you can choose a more descriptive name. Let's modify the stack implementation to use generics:

```csharp
class Stacker<T>
{
    private T[] stack;
    private int top;

    public Stacker()
    {
        stack = new T[100];
        top = -1;
    }

    public void Push(T item)
    {
        stack[++top] = item;
    }

    public T Pop()
    {
        return stack[top--];
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a generic class `Stacker<T>`, where `T` represents the type parameter. The stack is now an array of type `T`, and the `Push` and `Pop` methods use `T` as the parameter and return type, respectively.

Now, let's see how we can use this generic stack:

```csharp
Stacker<double> doubleStack = new Stacker<double>();
doubleStack.Push(3.14);
double number = doubleStack.Pop();

Stacker<int> intStack = new Stacker<int>();
intStack.Push(42);
int integer = intStack.Pop();

Stacker<string> stringStack = new Stacker<string>();
stringStack.Push("hello");
string str = stringStack.Pop();
```

With generics, we can create instances of `Stacker` with different type arguments, such as `double`, `int`, or `string`. The code is now more flexible, type-safe, and eliminates the need for boxing and casting operations.

## Generic Type Constraints

While generics provide flexibility, not all .NET types can be used as type arguments for generic methods. To ensure that only compatible types can be used, we can apply type constraints. Type constraints define requirements for the type arguments used in a generic item.

Let's consider a generic method called `WhichIsFirst`, which compares two candidates and returns the first one based on the `CompareTo` method:

```csharp
T WhichIsFirst<T>(T candidate1, T candidate2)
{
    if (candidate1.CompareTo(candidate2) >= 0)
    {
        return candidate1;
    }
    else
    {
        return candidate2;
    }
}
```

The above implementation assumes that the type `T` supports the `CompareTo` method. However, not all types in .NET provide this method. To enforce the requirement, we can use a type constraint using the `where` keyword:

```csharp
T WhichIsFirst<T>(T candidate1, T candidate2) where T : IComparable
{
    if (candidate1.CompareTo(candidate2) >= 0)
    {
        return candidate1;
    }
    else
    {
        return candidate2;
    }
}
```

With the `where T : IComparable` constraint, the `WhichIsFirst` method can only accept type arguments that implement the `IComparable` interface, ensuring the presence of the `CompareTo` method.

Here are some commonly used type constraints:

- `where T : struct`: Requires `T` to be a value type.
- `where T : class`: Requires `T` to be a reference type.
- `where T : MyBaseClass`: Requires `T` to inherit from `MyBaseClass`.
- `where T : IMyInterface`: Requires `T` to implement `IMyInterface`.
- `where T : U`: Requires `T` to inherit from `U`.
- `where T : new()`: Requires `T` to have a public parameterless constructor.

By applying type constraints, we can ensure that the generic code is optimized for specific types and provide compile-time safety.

## Benefits of Generics

Generics offer several benefits in C# and .NET:

- **Type Safety**: Generics provide compile-time type checking, reducing the risk of type-related errors.
- **Code Reusability**: Generic code can be reused with different data types, reducing code duplication.
- **Performance Optimization**: The compiler generates specialized code for each unique data type, resulting in better performance compared to non-generic code.
- **Flexibility**: Any .NET type can be used as a type argument, allowing for a wide range of data types in generic implementations.

By leveraging generics, you can write more efficient, flexible, and reusable code in C# and .NET.

## Conclusion

Generics provide a powerful tool for creating reusable and type-safe code that can handle various data types. They offer performance benefits, reduce code duplication, and enhance the overall robustness of your applications. Experiment with generics in your own projects to take advantage of their capabilities and improve your code.
