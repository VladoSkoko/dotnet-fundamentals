# Installing .NET

.NET is a framework that developers need to install on their computers in order to write code that utilizes its capabilities. In addition to developer machines, there are other locations where .NET installations may be required, such as build servers in continuous integration and deployment systems. This lesson covers the installation of .NET in various scenarios, including the necessary components and considerations for different types of applications.

## <a name="installing-net-sdk"></a>Installing .NET SDK
To begin writing .NET code, developers need to install the .NET SDK, which includes both the .NET runtime and the necessary tools. The SDK allows developers to build, test, and publish .NET applications. It also provides a command-line interface for managing .NET applications. Additionally, the SDK offers templates and sample applications to aid developers in creating new .NET projects quickly and easily.

## <a name="installing-net-on-application-computers"></a>Installing .NET on Application Computers
When deploying .NET applications, specific parts of .NET must be available on the target machines. The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is a vital component that powers the application, managing memory, threads, and resource loading. At a minimum, the CLR and the application executable are required. The additional .NET components necessary depend on the type of application being deployed. Web applications installed on servers require web-specific libraries, while desktop applications installed on user computers need desktop-specific libraries. Since .NET is cross-platform, the requirements may differ between Linux and Mac systems.

## <a name="clr-and-application-execution"></a>CLR and Application Execution
The CLR (Common Language Runtime) is responsible for executing .NET applications. It includes the just-in-time compiler, the garbage collector, and core libraries needed for running applications. The .NET runtime installation provides both the CLR and a collection of pre-built libraries. These libraries contain thousands of types, which are organized into namespaces. Namespaces group related code and help avoid naming collisions. Assemblies represent the physical files that contain these types.

## <a name="selective-net-library-installation"></a>Selective .NET Library Installation
In previous versions of .NET, the runtime installation included all .NET libraries, resulting in unnecessary libraries occupying storage space. However, with newer versions, you can bundle the CLR and a subset of libraries in a publisher package. This approach installs only the required libraries with the application and removes them upon uninstallation. It helps eliminate redundant libraries and reduces storage requirements.

## <a name="understanding-the-net-runtime"></a>Understanding the .NET Runtime
The term "runtime" is used in two contexts within .NET. The .NET runtime refers to the complete package, which contains the CLR and the .NET libraries. The CLR, part of the runtime, is responsible for executing the code. The .NET libraries consist of pre-built code distributed in assemblies. Depending on the installation, these libraries may be referred to as the Base Class Libraries (BCL) in the .NET Framework or CoreFX in .NET. Both contain numerous types that provide functionality for various development tasks.

## <a name="different-net-runtimes"></a>Different .NET Runtimes
There are three primary runtimes available in .NET:
1. The .NET Runtime: This is the base runtime, allowing the execution of console applications. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. ASP.NET Core Runtime: Used for running ASP.NET Core applications and services. It includes the full .NET Core runtime, along with additional features like middleware, routing, and web hosting. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
3. Desktop Runtime: Install this runtime to run .NET Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications and Windows Forms Desktop Apps on Windows. It is not the same as the .NET Framework that comes bundled with Windows.

## <a name="differentiating-net-sdk-and-runtime"></a>Differentiating .NET SDK and Runtime
It is important to distinguish between the .NET SDK and the .NET runtime. The SDK encompasses the runtime and provides additional tools, libraries, and compilers necessary for building, testing, and publishing .NET applications. It includes a command-line interface for managing .NET projects and offers templates and sample applications for developers to leverage. The runtime, on the other hand, focuses solely on executing .NET applications.

## <a name="installing-net-through-visual-studio-2022"></a>Installing .NET Through Visual Studio 2022
Visual Studio 2022, a comprehensive developer IDE, automatically installs the .NET SDK along with its components. By installing Visual Studio, developers gain access to the necessary tools for .NET development without the need for separate SDK installations.

## <a name="additional-net-sdk-libraries"></a>Additional .NET SDK Libraries
In addition to the core .NET SDK, there are several libraries available for specific development scenarios. These libraries include Xamarin Form libraries, Azure Functions, and Blazor WebAssembly, among others. They provide additional functionality and capabilities to extend the .NET development ecosystem.

## <a name="alternative-installation-methods"></a>Alternative Installation Methods
While the primary focus of this lesson is on the installation of .NET using the provided methods, it is worth noting that there are various alternative installation approaches available. These alternative methods cater to specific requirements and environments. For more details on different installation options, refer to the official documentation from Microsoft.

**Note:** The content in this lesson is subject to change based on updates and newer releases of .NET. Always refer to the official documentation and relevant resources for the latest information.
