## Overview of .NET <a name="overview-of-net"></a>
In this lesson, we will explore the .NET framework and its fundamental capabilities. .NET is a free development platform created by Microsoft, widely used for building various types of applications. It offers cross-platform support for MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows. The entire .NET platform is open source, with code and product roadmaps available on GitHub. The primary programming language for .NET is C#, but other languages like Visual Basic and F# are also supported. Let's dive into the details.

## Evolution of .NET <a name="evolution-of-net"></a>

The evolution of .NET has been marked by significant advancements and changes over the years. Let's delve into the details:

### The .NET Framework <a name="the-net-framework"></a>
The .NET Framework, released in 2002, was the original modernized programming framework developed by Microsoft. It was designed to support multiple operating systems and programming languages. However, it primarily became a Windows development framework. The .NET Framework supported more than 20 languages initially and underwent several improvements over its lifespan, with 16 versions released. It became an integral part of Windows installations. The last version, .NET Framework 4.8, was released and will continue to receive security and reliability bug fixes.

### Introduction of .NET Core <a name="introduction-of-net-core"></a>
In 2016, Microsoft introduced .NET Core as the successor to the .NET Framework. It was a completely rewritten and modern replacement, focusing on improved performance, scalability, and cross-platform support. .NET Core was designed to be open source and embraced by the development community. It worked seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. Unlike the .NET Framework, it was not tied exclusively to Windows development.

### Rebranding to .NET <a name="rebranding-to-net"></a>
To emphasize the main implementation going forward, Microsoft rebranded .NET Core to simply ".NET" in 2020. This rebranding consolidated the framework's identity and highlighted its role as the primary framework for future development. The rebranding represented a continuation of the work done in .NET Core, while also embracing the broader .NET ecosystem.

### Latest Releases <a name="latest-releases"></a>
Under the .NET Core name, there have been seven releases. However, since the rebranding to .NET, three additional releases have been introduced, with new versions planned for release every year in November. Notably, .NET Core skipped version 4 to avoid confusion with the .NET Framework 4.x versions. It's important to note that while .NET is the main implementation moving forward, .NET Framework 4.x continues to be supported, allowing existing applications built on the older framework to remain in use.

## Key Features of .NET <a name="key-features-of-net"></a>
.NET offers several key features that make it a powerful development platform. Some notable features include:

- **Cross-platform**: .NET enables application development on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Open Source**: The entire .NET platform is open source, fostering community collaboration and innovation.
- **Backward Compatibility**: .NET is designed to be backward compatible with the .NET Framework, reducing the effort required to migrate existing code.
- **Scalability**: .NET Core provides improved scalability and performance compared to earlier versions.
- **Extensive Class Libraries**: .NET offers a vast collection of class libraries, also known as base class libraries or core FX libraries, providing pre-built types and code for application development.

## Application Models in .NET <a name="application-models-in-net"></a>
.NET supports a wide range of application types, allowing developers to build diverse software solutions. Some of the application models in .NET include:

- Cloud Apps: .NET offers support for cloud-native applications, web apps, web APIs, microservices, and serverless functions in Azure.
- Windows Apps: Developers can build Windows applications using frameworks such as Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Universal Windows Platform (UWP), and Windows services.
- Cross-Platform: .NET facilitates cross-platform development for desktop applications, mobile apps, games, Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, and machine learning using frameworks like ML.NET.
- Growing Container Support: .NET has growing support for containerization, enabling efficient deployment and management of applications.

## The .NET SDK and Runtime <a name="the-net-sdk-and-runtime"></a>
To work with .NET, developers use the .NET SDK and runtime. The SDK includes the necessary tools, documentation, and libraries for writing .NET applications, while the runtime is responsible for executing the .NET apps. The .NET runtime is installed on end-user machines, and developers install it along with the SDK on their computers. Some components of the .NET SDK include:

- **.NET CLI**: The cross-platform command-line interface for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications. It provides tools like the Roslyn compilers for code compilation and disassemblers for reading compiled code.

## Class Libraries in .NET <a name="class-libraries-in-net"></a>
.NET provides a comprehensive set of class libraries, which are the base class libraries or core FX libraries. These libraries offer a wide range of pre-built types and code that developers can leverage in their applications. The class libraries are organized differently in newer versions of .NET, but they offer thousands of choices for developers. We will explore these libraries in detail throughout this course.

## Types of Applications in .NET <a name="types-of-applications-in-net"></a>
In .NET, you can develop various types of applications. Here are some examples:

1. **Cloud-Native Applications**: Build scalable and resilient cloud applications using Azure services and frameworks provided by .NET.
2. **Web Applications**: Develop web applications using frameworks like ASP.NET Core, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive web experiences.
3. **Microservices**: Design and implement microservices architectures using .NET Core, allowing modular and independent service development.
4. **Windows Applications**: Create Windows applications using frameworks such as Windows Forms, WPF, UWP, or develop Windows services.
5. **Cross-Platform Desktop Applications**: Build cross-platform desktop applications using .NET frameworks that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
6. **Mobile Applications**: Develop mobile applications for iOS, Android, and other platforms using Xamarin, a cross-platform development tool built on top of .NET.
7. **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Utilize .NET for developing IoT solutions by leveraging the platform's capabilities in connectivity, device management, and data processing.
8. **Machine Learning**: Use ML.NET, a machine learning framework provided by .NET, to build and train machine learning models for various applications.

## Third-Party Implementations <a name="third-party-implementations"></a>
Apart from Microsoft's official .NET implementations, third-party frameworks and platforms have emerged. One prominent implementation is the open-source Mono Project, which supports Unix, Linux, Mac, and other platforms. Xamarin, built on top of the Mono runtime, allows developers to create cross-platform mobile applications for iOS, Android, and more using .NET and C#. Microsoft acquired Xamarin in 2016, integrating its products and services into the Microsoft developer ecosystem. Xamarin.Forms, a UI toolkit for mobile applications, eventually led to the development of Multi-platform App UI (MAUI), considered the successor to Xamarin.Forms. Additionally, Unity, a popular game creation platform, is based on a fork of the Mono Project and allows game code to be written in C#.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
In this lesson, we explored the .NET framework and its evolution. We learned about the key features of .NET, the different application models it supports, the components of the .NET SDK and runtime, the extensive class libraries available, and the variety of application types developers can build using .NET. We also discussed the rebranding of .NET Core to .NET and the inclusion of third-party implementations such as Mono and Xamarin. Throughout this course, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of .NET, enabling you to write interesting and useful applications and services using this powerful development platform.
